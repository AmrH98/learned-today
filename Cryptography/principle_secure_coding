Assumptions:
	Assumptions are common element of any programming project and can usually be understood to be a set of constraints that narrow the scope of the project both technically and functionally. A good requirements analysis will result in a functional specification that outlines what the program/solution should do, who will use it and why. In that sense a functional spec can be seen as a collection of assumptions that have been validated with business. This is why some programmers consider assumptions to be a bad thing as they might not have been checked with the prospective users of the system, leading to a dangerous misalignment on scope and functionality.
To illustrate what assumptions programmers can make, here are a few examples:
"The system will never be used by multiple users at once." This avoids the need for concurrency support, this is a dangerous assumption these days since it's hardly ever true.
"We expect 1000 requests a day for the first year, ramping up to 5000 within 3 years." This can determine technical resources and the level of optimisation required.
"The discombobulator won't ever be confabulated." Statements like these simplify the responsibilities of the program and specify the behaviour. A less abstract example would be "A customer can't ever have more than one account."
"The system needs to run on a Linux environment."
The reason these can be dangerous is when they're not checked with the users first. If you build your entire solution without supporting multiple-user access and it then turns out that Bob from accounting also needs to approve Sales Orders while Alice is busy adjusting them you get to redesign your system.
Now, when it comes to programming tests like the ones you describe, assumptions have a more important role: they reduce the example scenario to something that has a workable solution and a scope that's limited enough to be developed by one person in a few hours. The goal of such an exercise is not to deliver a working solution but to show that you can correctly analyse the requirements of the system, identify pitfalls and account for possible issues. All those will be listed in your assumptions. Explaining them correctly shows that you can look past the basics in the use case description, analyse a complex system and reduce it to its core features. These are all vital skills for a good programmer.

Week 3:
	Fragile and robust coding styles
	Robust programming basic principles 
	Queue management routine
		Order of parameters easy to confuse
		Parameters values have arbitrary meanings
		No check for an attempt to delete a deleted or non existent queue 
		Overflow
		Underflow
		Incorrect variable values
		Not checked
	Queue Structure
		Token to index into array of queue 
		Prevent dangling reference
			Include in each token a nonce
			Index and nonce stays active
			https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS7K4U_9.0.5/com.ibm.websphere.zseries.doc/ae/cwbs_noncev6.html
			Construct token to not be valid
			DON’T RETURN POINTER TO INTERNAL STRUCTURE, use tokens
	Error Handling
		Convention
			Associate error message saved externally in an visible buffer
			Example using snprintf() not guarded against string attack, its only called within library ( not for all cases )
			Example using strcpy instead of strncpy might overflow the pr
	Cohesion
	New interfaces
	Token generation
		Make interface simple even for internal use only
		Check everything even internal generated parameters
		Give useful error messages and describe the error precisely 
	Token interpretation 
		Make parameters quantity that can be checked for validity 
		Check for references of outdated data
		Creating Queue 
		Deleting queue
		Adding and Removing elements in queue
